<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<ol>

<li>Register on the website.
 When registering we <strong>highly</strong> recommend using your <strong>LinkedIN</strong>, <strong>Google+</strong>, or <strong>Facebook</strong> account to speed up the process. 
 After logging in the first time, you will be asked a few questions about yourself, starting with general questions like your name, etc.,  
 and then more specific questions about your class, major, and skills & experience.  
 <strong>You will not be registered to compete until your profile is complete.</strong> 
 If your registration gets interrupted, you can resume it by logging in again by the same method you used before. 
 The system will then prompt you to complete your registration. </li>
<br> 
<li><strong>Confirm your eligibility to win.</strong> 
The eligibility rules are given in the Rules & Policies section of the Competitors Guide. 
Please free to contact us to discuss any questions about your eligibility. </li>

<li> <strong>Acquire and then work with mentors (up to 2) as required.</strong>Teams without a registered mentor listed on their team rosters by the designated date will not be permitted to continue. Further, teams will be required to provide evidence that they have actively worked with their mentors throughout the authoring and revision process. </li>

</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<li><strong>Polish up your public directory profile.</strong>
Once registered, you can take your time spiffing up your public profile that will be published in the competition directory. 
<strong>Log in using whatever method (LinkedIN, Google+, Facebook, username/password) you used to register. 
(Note: this is very important; if you choose another method then you may end up with two accounts and lots of confusion later on.)</strong> 
Then you can change your picture, craft your skills & experience entry, and even add social links to your profile listing.
</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Ask lots of questions.</strong> There is a lot of material here on the website, which can make things confusing sometimes, especially in the beginning. 
So speak up when that happens! 
Your questions will help us make it better for you and everyone who comes after you. 
If you don't know who to ask, use our Contact Us page to email your question, and we'll get it to the right person.</li>
