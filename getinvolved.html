<h1><center>Fairfield University Business Plan Competition</center></h1>

<h2>Get Involved</h2>
<p>The Business Plan Competition would not be possible without the assistance of an army of alumni, business leaders, and professionals. Maybe you could join us.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Join the mailing list.</strong> You will receive a Fairfield BPC Update newsletter by email about once per month between August and April with information about recent and upcoming events. The signups are right here on this page. </li>
<br>
<li><strong>Become a mentor.</strong> As the Competition grows every year, so does our need for mentors. Each team is required to have at least one mentor, preferably someone with both the time and the experience to guide a group of undergraduates through the complexities of conceiving, planning, and then pitching a business. The effort is well worth it!</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Lend your expertise</strong> While many entrepreneurs like to think they can do it all on their own, often they need to enlist the help of specialists in areas like accounting, IT, manufacturing, etc. in order to get things done. To fill this need for our students, each year we assemble a small panel of advisors that the teams can consult while developing and vetting their plans.  The time commitment is small, perhaps an evening or two and a few emails, but the impact on the final product can be tremendous.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Sponsor us, in cash or in kind.</strong> We operate on a small budget, with 100% of the funds provided by outside sponsors. We also accept donations in kind, where a service is offered as a prize to one of the winning teams.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>If you'd like to participate then come to an event or send us a note to get started.</p>
